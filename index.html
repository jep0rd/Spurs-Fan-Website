            The nets were on fire in San Antonio tonight. The Spurs set a new franchise-high 22 three pointers, breaking the record set by the 2021 team, who hit 20 on January 5th against the Clippers. The Silver and Black started to look more like the Spurs of old, with unselfish play and “good to great” shot selection in their 132-114 win over the Orlando Magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Spurs were led by their front court, Zach Collins and Jeremy Sochan who put up 25 and 29 respectively. Collins got the Spurs started with a hot start in the 1st quarter, hitting three shots from behind the arc, and scoring 13 points. The offense was running through the starting big man in the high and low post, making the defense pay for leaving him open, and banging with the physical Wendell Carter Jr. inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Spurs bench unit let the Magic stick around whenever it took over in the 2nd and 3rd quarters. The Sandro Mamukelashvili on Paolo Banchero matchup was a particularly beneficial one for the Magic in those minutes. Banchero finished the contest with 27 points and 6 rebounds on 11-21 shooting. The bench finished the game with only 1 player having a positive plus minus in significant minutes: Blake Wesley.

            Despite not winning many games this season, the Spurs have given fans a reason to watch with some exciting play as the regular season winds down. After two straight overtime losses to Western Conference playoff teams, including one in which they blew a 29-point lead, San Antonio bounced back with a 126-118 comeback win over the Atlanta Hawks. Despite being down 22 at halftime, the Spurs capitalized on some sloppy play from Atlanta in the second half and rode hot shooting from their two wing scorers, Keldon Johnson and Devin Vassell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vassell has looked closer to the player he was pre-injury in the last two contests. He’s looked confident getting to his spots, rising up and firing from both the mid-range and deep off of the bounce and coming off of screens. Against Atlanta he scored 29 points on 12-17 shooting, and went 5-8 from deep. His defense was beneficial as well, stealing the ball from Atlanta 3 times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Johnson has been the heart and soul of this squad for most of the season. He plays with outward fire, and never stops coming at the opponent both in his drives to the rim and on hustle plays. He put up 29 points, 12 rebounds and 5 assists in the win. Johnson’s jump shot as has looked much better recently as well, going 2-3 from range against the Hawks. He’s pulling the trigger with confidence and making defenses play for going under screens on the pick and roll.
